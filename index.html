        <h2>What Affects Mental Health in Young People?</h2>

    <div class="factors-grid">
        <div class="factor-card">
            <h3>Social Pressure & Comparison</h3>
            <p>Constant pressure from peers, school, and social media can lead to anxiety, low self-esteem, and feelings of inadequacy. The curated perfection seen online creates unrealistic standards that can damage self-worth.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="factor-card">
            <h3>Relationships & Trauma</h3>
            <p>Exposure to trauma or unhealthy relationships can deeply affect emotional well-being. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been shown to significantly increase the risk of mental health challenges later in life.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="factor-card">
            <h3>Future Uncertainty</h3>
            <p>High expectations and fear of not meeting goals can cause stress, burnout, and depression. The pressure to make life-altering decisions about education and career paths during adolescence creates significant anxiety.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="factor-card">
            <h3>Biological Factors</h3>
            <p>Genetics, brain chemistry, and hormonal changes during puberty can play a significant role in mental health conditions. Understanding these biological components helps reduce stigma and promotes effective treatment.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="factor-card">
            <h3>Environmental Stressors</h3>
            <p>Living in unstable or unsafe environments, experiencing poverty, or facing discrimination can contribute to mental health challenges. Systemic issues create additional barriers to accessing care and support.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="factor-card">
            <h3>Academic Pressure</h3>
            <p>The demand to perform well in school, excessive homework, and high-stakes testing can be overwhelming and lead to anxiety, sleep disorders, and burnout among students.</p>
