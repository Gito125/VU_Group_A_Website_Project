    <!-- About Section -->
    <section class="section" id="about_section">
        <p>
            Little Minds was established in response to the growing mental health crisis affecting young people today. 
            We recognized a critical need to build specialized support—support that is professionally guided and deeply empathetic 
            to the unique challenges of adolescence, childhood, and young adulthood.
        </p>

        <p>
            We are dedicated to moving beyond simple awareness. Our core purpose is to actively transform the mental health of young people, 
            helping them feel better and receive the support they deserve. We work hard to ensure our care is reliable, our lessons are helpful, 
            and that young people can easily ask questions and receive help.

    <section class="section">
        <h3 class="section-title">Values Guiding Our Work</h3>
        
        <p class="section-intro">Our values are the foundation of everything we do at Little Minds. They guide our approach, shape our programs, and ensure we provide the highest quality support to young people facing mental health challenges.</p>

        <ol class="values-list">
            <li><strong>Respect:</strong> We approach every individual with kindness and respect, listening without judgment. We honor each person's unique journey and create spaces where diverse perspectives and experiences are valued. Our team is trained in cultural competency to ensure we serve youth from all backgrounds with dignity.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Accessible:</strong> We ensure our support is free and easy to access for all young people, regardless of financial situations. We offer multiple access points including in-person sessions, virtual counseling, text-based support, and community outreach programs. All our services are available in multiple languages and designed with neurodiversity in mind.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Professionalism:</strong> We provide guidance backed by verified resources and trained professionals. Our team includes licensed therapists, certified counselors, and mental health specialists who participate in ongoing training. We follow evidence-based practices and maintain the highest ethical standards in all our interventions.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> We maintain strict privacy standards to create a safe environment where youth can share openly. All personal information is protected, and we follow HIPAA-compliant procedures. Young people can trust that their stories and struggles remain confidential within the bounds of safety.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Empowerment:</strong> We focus on building resilience and self-advocacy skills in young people. Rather than creating dependency, we equip youth with tools and strategies to navigate challenges independently. Our programs emphasize strength-building and help youth recognize their own capacity for growth and healing.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> We work together with families, schools, and communities to create comprehensive support systems. We believe mental health support is most effective when it involves multiple stakeholders who can provide consistent care and understanding across different environments.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Innovation:</strong> We continuously evolve our approaches based on the latest research and youth feedback. Our programs incorporate creative therapies, technology solutions, and emerging best practices to meet the changing needs of today's youth in an increasingly complex world.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Hope-Oriented:</strong> We maintain an unwavering belief in every young person's potential for healing and growth. Our approach focuses on strengths rather than deficits, possibilities rather than limitations, and always emphasizes that recovery and wellbeing are achievable goals.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="values-commitment">
            <h4>Our Commitment to These Values</h4>
            <p>These values aren't just words on a page - they're living principles that guide our daily work. We regularly evaluate our programs against these standards, provide ongoing training to ensure our team embodies these values, and welcome feedback from the youth we serve about how we can better live up to these ideals.</p>
